### Installation

###### AS OF NOW THERES NO VERSION OUT, BECAUSE THE APP IS NOT COMPLETED AT ALL, I BARELY MADE ENOUGH TO BRODCAST THE SERVERS TO LAN BUT IT AINT COMPLETE AT ALL, SO LOOKING FOR DEVS TO CARRY ON THIS WORK!!

### How To Use / Implement

*Well, Well, If You Made This Far Then I Must Say This Project Piqued Your Interests, So Look Below To Know How To Install&Run Demo Version Of This Program And Test Out The Existing Features Yourself!!*

Download/Clone This Repo From Github And Extract It, Find A File Called **run.py** , Open It In IDLE And Run IT!!

### Development

**Now Here Comes The Important Part!**

We are in dire need for developers who can work on this half-assed project and complete it to make something great, as of now this is a broken project, I merely made a proof of concept demo version for other developers to see and made a base for others to use/refer, It needs a really good amount of work before this program can be made production ready, **it doesnt mean that it can't be made at all, but I'm tired doing this all alone(have many other stuff in my life to concentrate on) so i can no longer complete this just on my own..**  However it doesnt mean an end for it, infact if someone worthy with enough potential to carry forward it comes to me, i will as well do everything in my power to once again make it. *So im really looking forward for your contributions, you can contact me on my discord IGN: **Agent_Orange#9852** and ask for this project and i will assist you :D!!*
### Todos

 - Implement Full Login Part Of Server (Minor Task)
 - **Connect Peers(P2P) To Allow Data Exchange (CORE)**
 - *Redirect UDP Data From Minecraft Client To Local Server And Vice Versa (Major Task)*
 - Improve The General Interface Of Program (Minor Task)


### What Has Been Done
